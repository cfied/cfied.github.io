I love theoretical mathematics. It is the undoubted absoluteness of mathematically proven statements that fascinates me the most. Mathematics is a language that allows you to define, analyse and abstract complex structures and to conclude precisely. It can be very challenging, but it is so rewarding when you realize that a proof works out, that things begin to fall in place and fit together nicely.

On the other hand I am fascinated by practical computer science. I want to understand how our fast developing technology works and how we can make it work for us.
